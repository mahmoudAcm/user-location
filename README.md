# User Location

<p>you can use any free service to get the location with the help of window.navigator
the service I used is https://opencagedata.com/api</p>

<p>if you will use <a href='https://opencagedata.com' target='_blank'>opencagedata.com<a/> then create an account to get the apiKey or use any available service and follow instructions.</p>

<p>if you will use another service all you need to change is in the getLocation function is sure the URL and the returned data.</p>

happy codding ðŸ˜‰.
